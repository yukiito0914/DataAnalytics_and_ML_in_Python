This directory contains scripts written in Python for simulation or data analysis.
## random_walker.ipynb
This notebook simulates and visualizes random walk processes for multiple entities, analyzing the resulting position distributions through Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and Cumulative Probability Functions (CPFs).
## vaccine_simulation.ipynb
This notebook simulates the effectiveness of vaccination using permutation testing to assess the likelihood of observing a statistically significant reduction in infection rates in a treated group compared to a control group.
## motif_finding.ipynb
 implements various bioinformatics algorithms, including functions for analyzing genetic sequences. It covers tasks like calculating Hamming distance, translating RNA into proteins, finding DNA motifs, RNA splicing, identifying common substrings or subsequences, and constructing shortest common supersequences.
