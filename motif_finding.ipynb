    "## 1: Evolution as a Sequence of Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "A mutation is simply an error that occurs during the creation or replication of nucleic acids, particularly DNA. Since nucleic acids are crucial for cellular functions, mutations often have a ripple effect throughout the cell. Although mutations are errors, a rare mutation can provide a beneficial trait to the cell. In fact, the long-term effects of evolution are the cumulative result of advantageous microscopic mutations over generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic and common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point mutation, which involves the replacement of one base with another at a single nucleotide. In DNA, this also requires a change in the complementary base.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA strands from different organisms or species are considered homologous if they share a common ancestor, and counting the base differences in homologous strands gives the minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred over their evolutionary history.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to minimize the number of point mutations separating two species because, based on the principle of parsimony, evolutionary histories should be explained as simply as possible."

    "\n",
    "Just as nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides, proteins are chains of smaller molecules called amino acids; 20 amino acids commonly appear in every species. How are proteins created? The genetic code, discovered throughout the course of a number of ingenious experiments in the late 1950s, details the translation of an RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) into amino acids for protein creation. The apparent difficulty in translation is that somehow 4 RNA bases must be translated into a language of 20 amino acids; in order for every possible amino acid to be created, we must translate 3-nucleobase strings (called codons) into amino acids. Note that there are 4<sup>3</sup>=64\n",
    " possible codons, so that multiple codons may encode the same amino acid. Two special types of codons are the start codon (AUG), which codes for the amino acid methionine always indicates the start of translation, and the three stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA), which do not code for an amino acid and cause translation to end."

    "In the nucleus, an enzyme called RNA polymerase (RNAP) starts transcription by breaking the bonds between DNA's complementary bases. It then creates pre-mRNA using one DNA strand as a template, adding complementary RNA bases, with uracil replacing thymine. The other DNA strand, known as the coding strand, is nearly identical to the RNA strand, except for thymine being replaced by uracil. As RNAP progresses, the separated DNA strands quickly rejoin. Pre-mRNA is then processed by removing non-coding segments (introns) and joining coding segments (exons) through a process called splicing, carried out by the spliceosome. Exons together form the gene's coding region, responsible for protein production."
